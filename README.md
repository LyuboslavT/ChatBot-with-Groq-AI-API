Welcome, AI Engineers! 🚀 In this project, you’ll bring **artificial intelligence to life** by creating a chatbot powered by the **Groq API**. This chatbot will respond to user messages in real time using advanced AI models! Instead of a graphical interface, we’re keeping it sleek and **console-based**—just like real-world API integrations.
